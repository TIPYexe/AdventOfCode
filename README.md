# Advent of Code

Inside this repository, you will find my solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 competition. Although I have completed only the first 4 days so far, each solution is carefully crafted and thoroughly tested. The Advent of Code is an exciting programming challenge that presents unique coding puzzles for each day of December leading up to Christmas.
